## üìä Priority Matrix

### üî• Critical (Blocks Major Use Cases)

#### 1. **Inline Lua Code Execution** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Status:** MISSING - CRITICAL FOR RPG GAMES

**The Problem:**
- The editor creates stories with `{{lua: ... }}` syntax
- The runtime engine does NOT execute Lua code in passages
- All RPG templates use Lua code that won't work at runtime
- Variables can be displayed `{{health}}` but not modified in passages

**What's Missing:**
```whisker
<!-- This is written in the editor but doesn't work in runtime -->
{{lua:
    local roll = math.random(1,20)
    game_state:set("check_result", roll)
}}

<!-- This works (display only) -->
Your health: {{health}}/{{max_health}}

<!-- This doesn't work (modification) -->
{{lua: game_state:set("health", game_state:get("health") - 10) }}
```

**Impact:**
- ‚õî All 20+ passage templates don't work in runtime
- ‚õî RPG systems are broken at runtime
- ‚õî Combat, skill checks, leveling all non-functional
- ‚õî Story is editor-only, not playable

**Solution Needed:**
- Implement Lua sandbox in web runtime
- Use lua.vm.js or fengari (Lua in JS)
- Execute `{{lua: ... }}` blocks safely
- Expose game_state API to Lua context

**Effort:** HIGH (2-3 days)
**Value:** CRITICAL
**Priority:** #1 - MUST FIX FIRST

---

#### 2. **Conditional Content System** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Status:** PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED

**The Problem:**
- Editor supports `{{#if}}` syntax
- Runtime may not fully support complex conditionals
- No `{{#each}}` for loops
- Limited logical operators

**What's Missing:**
```whisker
<!-- Basic conditionals (might work) -->
{{#if health > 0}}
You are alive!
{{/if}}

<!-- Complex conditionals (probably broken) -->
{{#if health > 50 and stamina >= 10 and has_sword}}
[[Power Attack->attack]]
{{/if}}

<!-- Loops (doesn't exist) -->
{{#each inventory}}
- {{name}}: {{quantity}}
{{/each}}

<!-- Elsif chains (missing) -->
{{#if gold >= 100}}
  Rich!
{{#elsif gold >= 50}}
  Comfortable
{{#else}}
  Poor
{{/if}}
```

**Impact:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Complex branching logic hard to implement
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Inventory systems difficult
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Dynamic content limited

**Solution Needed:**
- Full Handlebars-like templating engine
- Support: if/elsif/else, each, unless, with
- Boolean operators: and, or, not, ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=
- Helper functions (custom conditionals)

**Effort:** MEDIUM (1-2 days)
**Value:** HIGH
**Priority:** #2
